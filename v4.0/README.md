[https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#github-pages](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#github-pages)

Draggable: [https://github.com/mzabriskie/react-draggable](https://github.com/mzabriskie/react-draggable)

Reactstrap: [https://reactstrap.github.io](https://reactstrap.github.io)

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

1. `npm start` Starts the development server.

2. `npm run build` Bundles the app into static files for production.

3. `npm test` Starts the test runner.

4. `npm run eject` Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

```
cd v4.0
npm start
```


## Installing Bootstrap:

`npm install bootstrap --save`

`npm install --save reactstrap@next react react-dom`
