# Prototype v4.0

## Installing React

```
npm i -g np

npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app v4.0
```

## Hosting on Github

Check out this link:

`https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages `


Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

1. `npm start` Starts the development server.

2. `npm run build` Bundles the app into static files for production.

3. `npm test` Starts the test runner.

4. `npm run eject` Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

```
cd v4.0
npm start
```


## Installing Bootstrap:

`npm install bootstrap --save`

`npm install --save reactstrap@next react react-dom`
